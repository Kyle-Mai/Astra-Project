### ICS4U 2017 - Final Project

# Project Astra

## Description

Project Astra is a Java-based experimental game created as a final project for the ICS4U class of 2017. It was designed to demonstrate a wide variety of different Java applications as well as to promote a style of programming that I wasn't familiar with.

## Design [WIP]

Project Astra is a simulation game based around the 4X genre - eXpand, eXplore, eXploit, and eXterminate.

The game is played in a 2D top-down map format - with the focus resting on grand strategy rather than individual control.

The goal is to expand and manage an interstellar empire and protect it from threats both inside and out.

A victory is reached once one of multiple victory conditions are met - such as controlling 80% of the map without any unstable colonies.

## Features [WIP]

- XML based modding. The game supports the addition and change of some core content (i.e. stars and planets) via the use of XML files. Mods can be enabled/disabled from the launcher.

- Dynamically generated content. Every game will be different, with a different map arrangement and different stars/planets arranged around that map.
