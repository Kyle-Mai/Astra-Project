### ICS4U 2017 - Final Project

# Project Astra

Project Version v;A0.33d6

## Description [WIP]

Project Astra is a Java-based experimental game created as a final project for the ICS4U class of 2017. It was designed to demonstrate a wide variety of different Java applications as well as to promote a style of programming that we weren't familiar with.

## Design and Features [WIP]

Project Astra is a simulation game based around the 4X genre - eXpand, eXplore, eXploit, and eXterminate.

The game is played in a 2D top-down map format - with the focus resting on grand strategy rather than individual control.

The goal is to expand and manage an interstellar empire and protect it from threats both inside and out.
