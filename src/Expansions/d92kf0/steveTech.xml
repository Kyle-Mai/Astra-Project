        <name>String Drive Prototype</name>
        <description>Our research into the mystery behind FTL travel is nearly complete. With this final step, we should be able to create a working FTL drive large enough to use on interstellar spacecraft.</description>

            <name>String Drive Prototype</name>
            <description>The string drive is the result of our experiments into FTL technology. The final hurdle - staying on course - was solved by laying a long line of specially manufactured material, known as the string-line. String drives utilize this material to maintain course, allowing for extremely fast and efficient travel through the galaxy.</description>

            <description>The Trailblazer is a sub-FTL ship that is used to lay down string-lines for FTL ships to travel along. By sending these ships out to nearby stars, we can begin laying down the framework to more efficiently expand our empire and explore the galaxy's mysteries.</description>
