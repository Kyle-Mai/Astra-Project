        <name>Gravastar</name>
        <description>A Gravastar forms when a collapsing star's mass causes the gravitational acceleration to exceed Planck's length. This creates a region around the star that is a void in the fabric of space-time - a gravitational vacuum. It is theorized that a Gravastar may be responsible for the creation of the known universe.</description>

        <description>A strange compact star, composed of quarks or bosons rather than the protons, neutrons, and electrons of conventional stars. While extraordinarily dense, they are unable to collapse due to quantum degeneracy pressure.</description>

        <description>The rotation of this Pulsar is so rapid that it is slowly beginning to grow unstable. Within a few thousand years, it will likely reach a breaking point and collapse into a Black Hole.</description>

        <name>Frozen Star</name>
        <description>This star contains an unusually high contentration of metallic elements, and very little hydrogen. The resulting lack of energy from fusing these metals makes the star incredibly cold.</description>

        <description>A Quasi-Star is a Population III star with a Black Hole at its center, cannibalizing the star from the inside out. It is somewhat similar to the Thorne-Zytkow Object, but far more sinister.</description>
