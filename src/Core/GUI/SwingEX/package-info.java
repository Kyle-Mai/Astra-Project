 SwingEX Alpha

 Repository with a bunch of extended and improved Swing elements.
 The SwingEX objects are called with the use of a X- prefix instead of Swing's default J-.

 The main purpose of SwingEX is the addition of new constructors, methods, and variables (so pretty much everything?) in order to improve the flexibility of Swing.
 It also removes many of the default styles of Swing objects, as their aesthetic is far too static.
