        <name>String Drive Prototype</name>
        <description>Our research into the mystery behind FTL travel is nearly complete. With this final step, we should be able to create a working FTL drive large enough to use on interstellar spacecraft.</description>

            <description>The string drive is the result of our experiments into FTL technology. The final hurdle - staying on course - was solved by laying a long line of specially manufactured material, known as the string-line. String drives utilize this material to maintain course, allowing for extremely fast and efficient travel through the galaxy.</description>
